ChannelEnginewill save this information to make sure that the next call to GET &#39;v2/products/data&#39; only returns the  products that really have changes (and therefore should be created, updated or deleted).  A channel willing to integrate with channelengine should therefore only do the following things:      1. Periodically poll &#39;v2/products/data&#39; for changes.      2. If any products are returned, save, update or remove these products.      3. Send the merchant references of the products that have succesfully been processed      in step 2 to POST &#39;v2/products/data&#39;.       These three simple steps will make sure that the products on the channel will be synchronized   with the products on ChannelEngine. ChannelEngine will use the API key to determine the customer  whose products should be returned. Note that child products are only returned if their parent product  has been acknowledged in a previous transaction. This way ChannelEngine knows the value of   &#39;ChannelParentReference&#39;.

ChannelEnginewill save this information to make sure that the next call to GET &#39;v2/products/data&#39; only returns the  products that really have changes (and therefore should be created, updated or deleted).  A channel willing to integrate with channelengine should therefore only do the following things:      1. Periodically poll &#39;v2/products/data&#39; for changes.      2. If any products are returned, save, update or remove these products.      3. Send the merchant references of the products that have succesfully been processed      in step 2 to POST &#39;v2/products/data&#39;.       These three simple steps will make sure that the products on the channel will be synchronized   with the products on ChannelEngine. ChannelEngine will use the API key to determine the customer  whose products should be returned. Note that child products are only returned if their parent product  has been acknowledged in a previous transaction. This way ChannelEngine knows the value of   &#39;ChannelParentReference&#39;.
